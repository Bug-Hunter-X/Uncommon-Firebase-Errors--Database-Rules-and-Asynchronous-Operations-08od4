This repository demonstrates two uncommon Firebase error scenarios: improperly configured database rules and race conditions due to asynchronous operations. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the flawed code leading to errors, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with explanations.  The errors are subtle and might be difficult to diagnose without a thorough understanding of Firebase's asynchronous nature and security rules.
