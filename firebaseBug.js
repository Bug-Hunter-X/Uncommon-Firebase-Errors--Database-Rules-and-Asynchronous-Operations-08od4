The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the database rules are incorrectly configured. For example, if you have rules that deny read access to certain nodes in your database, your application will fail to retrieve data from those nodes, and the Firebase SDK will throw an error.  This error may not always be immediately obvious, as the error message may be generic or unclear.  Debugging this requires careful examination of your database rules and the application's data access patterns.  Another example is improperly handling asynchronous operations, leading to race conditions where data is accessed before it's fully loaded, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.
